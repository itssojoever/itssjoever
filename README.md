- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joseph (Joe). I'm a student of International Relations & Modern Languages (French) but am learning coding as a hobby, as a means to create apps of use to me, and for a future career path
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI and practical applications that can help both myself and others. Aside from a brief stint with HTML, CSS, and some batch files back in the good ol' days (barely 10 years ago), I'm new to this stuff, so my code won't be perfect, but I hope to improve by putting into practice what I'm learning
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and some of its libraries
