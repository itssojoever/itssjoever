- 👋 Hi, I’m @itssojoever
- 👀 I’m interested in AI. At the moment! Aside from a stint with HTML, CSS, and some batch files back in the good ol' days (barely 10 years ago), I'm new to this stuff, so while AI is all the rage and interests me, I'm sure as I get into it there's many more interests to be discovered
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, and CSS. Intermittently. On and off. Not at all productively.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing yet
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can send me a message on here
